![Customer Insights](Image/customer_insights.png)
**Key Metrics:**
- Average Recency: 372 days  
- Average Frequency: 1.14  
- Average Monetary Value: \$784  
- Average RFM Score: 8.67  
- Distribution by region, segment, and age group  
- Retention rate trends (monthly and yearly)

**Segmentation Logic (RFM):**
- **Champions:** High frequency, high monetary value, recent purchases  
- **Loyal Customers:** Frequent buyers with consistent monetary value  
- **Potential Loyalists:** Newer customers with medium frequency  
- **At Risk:** Long recency and low frequency

## ⚙️ Technical Process

1. **Data Exploration (BigQuery)**
   - Cleaned and joined transactional tables (`orders`, `products`, `customers`, `inventory_items`)
   - Created derived tables for sales, margin, and customer cohorts.

2. **ETL Logic**
   - Aggregated by `order_id`, `product_id`, and `customer_id`
   - Created `sales_base` and `rfm_table` views for Power BI connection.

3. **Power BI Modeling**
   - Star schema with fact tables (`Sales`, `RFM`) and dimension tables (`Products`, `Customers`, `Calendar`)
   - Relationships defined with single-direction filters to ensure measure accuracy.

4. **DAX Measures**
   ```DAX
   Total Revenue = SUM('Sales Base'[sale_price])
   Total Profit = [Total Revenue] - SUM('Sales Base'[cost])
   Profit Margin % = DIVIDE([Total Profit], [Total Revenue], 0)

   Average Recency (Days) = AVERAGE(RFM[Recency_days])
   Average Monetary Value = AVERAGE(RFM[Monetary])
   Average Purchase Frequency = AVERAGE(RFM[Frequency])
   RFM Score = [Recency_Score] + [Frequency_Score] + [Monetary_Score]
   ```
