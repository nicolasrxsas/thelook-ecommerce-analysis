## 🎯 Analysis Objectives

This project seeks to answer three key questions:

### Customer Dynamics and Cohorts
* How do customers behave over time after their first purchase?
* How effective is customer retention?

### Sales and Margin Drivers (Core Question)
* What product categories generate the most revenue?
* What categories generate the highest profitability (margins)?
* Does the business rely on sales volume or high margins?

### Customer Value Patterns
* Is there a "high-value" customer profile, and how does it differ from low-value customers?
* How do the average ticket size and purchase frequency vary among customers?

## 🛠️ Tools Used
* **SQL (BigQuery):** For data extraction, transformation, and exploration.
* **Power BI:** For interactive visualization and insight presentation.
* **GitHub:** For version control and project documentation.

## 🚀 Project Value

This analysis aims to simulate a real-world business analytics scenario within an e-commerce context by:

* **Identifying strategic products** (revenue vs. profitability).
* **Understanding customer retention** and behavior.
* **Discovering high-value customer profiles.**

Thus, the project delivers not only dashboards but also **data-supported business stories**.
