### Exploration Notes

- Table `events` shows all the interactions that users had on the internet from different sources like Facebook and Email, including which browser was accessed and the user's location.

- the table `Products` can show in which distribution center the products are located. I think know this is important to optimize logistics processes

- Table `orders` has "user_id" column that can be joined with Ã¹sers`table. With that information we can know more about the status and location of the orders shipped and demographics information of purchasers
